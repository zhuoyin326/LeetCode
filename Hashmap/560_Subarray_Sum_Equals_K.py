Title: 560. Subarray Sum Equals K
Tag: Array, Hash Table, Prefix Sum
Difficulty: Medium

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-107 <= k <= 107
