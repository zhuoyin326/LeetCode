Title: 18. 4Sum
Tag: Array, Two Pointers, Sorting
Difficulty: Medium

Given an array nums of n integers, return an array of all the unique quadruplets [nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]] such that:
0 <= a, b, c, d < n
a, b, c, and d are distinct.
nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target
You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0
Output: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2]]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 200
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
