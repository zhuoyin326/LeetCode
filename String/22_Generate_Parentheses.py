Title: 22. Generate Parentheses
Tag: String, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking
Difficulty: Medium

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]
 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 8
