Title: 239. Sliding Window Maximum
Tag: Array, Queue, Sliding Window, Heap (Priority Queue), Monotonic Queue
Difficulty: Hard

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
Return the max sliding window.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]

Explanation: 
Window position	Max
------------------------	-----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7      3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7      3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7      5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7      5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7      6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]     7

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= k <= nums.length
