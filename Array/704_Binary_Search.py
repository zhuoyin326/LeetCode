Title: 704. Binary Search
Tag: Array, Binary Search
Difficulty: Easy

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.

# Define the binary search function with a sorted sequence and target.
def binarySearch(nums, target):
	# Define the left boundary.
	left = 0
	# Define the right boundary.
	right = len(nums) - 1
	
# Continue the while loop as long as the left boundary is less than or equal to the right boundary.
	while left <= right:
		# Calculate the middle index using the left and right boundaries. 
		mid = (left + right)//2
		# Situation 1: If the number at the middle index is equal to the target.
		if nums[mid] == target:
			# Target found, return middle index.
			return mid
		# Situation 2: If the number at the middle index is greater than the target.
		elif nums[mid] > target:
			# Search in the lower range by updating the right boundary to mid-1. 
			right = mid - 1
		# Situation 3: If the number at the middle index is less than the target.
		else:
			# Search in the upper range by updating the left boundary to mid+1.
			left = mid + 1
	# If the target was not found after the while loop,  return -1.
	return -1
