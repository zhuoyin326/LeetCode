Title: 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Tag: Linked List
Difficulty: Easy

Given the heads of two sorted linked lists list A and list B.
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. This list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. 
Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:

Input: listA = [1, 2, 4], listB = [1, 3, 4]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]

Example 2:
Input: listA = [], listB = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: listA = [], listB = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
