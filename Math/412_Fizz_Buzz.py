Title: 412. Fizz Buzz
Tag: Math, String, Simulation
Difficulty: Easy


Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104
